# TinDog

TinDog is basically a clone of tinder but the users have been swaped to Dogs. In this site I have applied all my basics of Bootstrap framework and made a responsive website which works quite well in the mobile screens also. Since this site only includes HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap, the functionalities will be not working which is attached in the site like buttons and links. 

You can have a look at the website by clicking below, Also attached a demo too.
